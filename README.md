# RadicalMart Message: Email

**RadicalMart Message: Email** is a messaging plugin for **RadicalMart** that delivers system and business notifications via **email**.
It acts as a transport layer for RadicalMart message events and does not implement business logic itself.

---

## Purpose

This plugin provides **email delivery** for messages generated by RadicalMart.

It is responsible only for:
- receiving prepared message payloads,
- rendering email content,
- sending emails using Joomla mail services.

All decisions about **when**, **why**, and **to whom** a message is sent are handled by RadicalMart core or other plugins.

---

## What this plugin does

- Listens to RadicalMart message events.
- Converts message payloads into email messages.
- Supports HTML and plain-text email formats.
- Uses Joomla mail configuration and transport.
- Ensures consistent email delivery for orders, statuses, and system notifications.

---

## What this plugin does NOT do

- ❌ Does not decide when messages are created  
- ❌ Does not calculate recipients  
- ❌ Does not contain order or business logic  
- ❌ Does not replace Joomla mail configuration  

This plugin is a **delivery channel**, not a workflow controller.

## Architecture role

In the RadicalMart messaging system:

```

RadicalMart Core / Plugins
↓
Message Event
↓
Message Transport Plugins
↓
Email

```

This plugin represents the **email transport implementation**.

---

## Message flow

1. RadicalMart creates a message payload.
2. A message event is triggered.
3. The Email Message plugin receives the payload.
4. Email content is rendered.
5. The message is sent using Joomla mailer.

---

## Configuration

The plugin has minimal configuration options.

Email delivery relies on:
- Joomla global mail settings
- Site language and templates
- Message payload structure provided by RadicalMart

---

## Installation

1. Install the plugin via Joomla:
   **System → Install → Extensions**
2. Enable the plugin:
   **System → Manage → Plugins → “RadicalMart Message: Email”**

The plugin can be enabled safely without additional configuration.

---

## Intended usage

This plugin is intended to be used together with:
- RadicalMart order processing
- Status change notifications
- Custom message-producing plugins

It can be replaced or extended by alternative message transports (e.g. SMS, API, queue-based systems).

---

## Developer notes

- Email formatting is isolated from business logic.
- Message payload structure is defined by RadicalMart.
- The plugin follows RadicalMart’s event-driven messaging architecture.
